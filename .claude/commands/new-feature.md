You are an expert software architect and technical lead. I need to implement a new feature. Your task is to: 

**Detailed Feature Plan:** 

Provide a comprehensive plan for the new feature, including its purpose, user stories, high-level components involved, and potential impact. Think about edge cases and dependencies.

**Granular Implementation Plan:** 

Break down the detailed feature plan into a highly granular, task-based implementation plan. Each task should be actionable and ideally represent a small, focused unit of work that could be a separate commit or a few hours of work. Include estimated effort if possible (e.g., '1-2 days').\n3.  

**GitHub Issue Format:** 

Present the output in Markdown format suitable for a GitHub issue. Use clear headings, bullet points, and code blocks where appropriate. The title of the issue should be concise and descriptive. The body should first include the detailed feature plan, followed by the granular implementation plan.

Please raise a GitHub issue with the detailed plan and mark it as enhancement.
